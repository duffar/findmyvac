# Find My Vaccine

A tool to help you locate COVID-19 vaccine appointment openings at nearby pharmacies. The data
behind this tool comes from https://www.vaccinespotter.org

# Development Setup

Currently this is a front-end only react app so it is very easy to deploy at providers such as Digital Ocean, Netlify, or AWS. Most of those providers can clone and build directly from the repo. 

Requirements:
- Node.js 14+
- npm

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/duffar/findmyvac.git`
2. Install dependencies (inside the repo): `npm install`
3. Run the application in dev mode: `npm start`

At this point the application should be running on localhost:3000. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# Using the Application
Basically just enter the initials of the states you wish to search, the maximum distance away to include, and your current location. Then press 'Find Providers' and the app will locate and display any providers with available appointments - sorted by distance.

The list includes links to the providers url for scheduling an appointment, as well as links to map directions, and additional details about the provider (which may include vaccines offered).


# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). As such the following information pertains as well.

## Additional Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
